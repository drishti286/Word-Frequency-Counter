# Word-Frequency-Counter
This project implements a Python-based word frequency analyzer that processes text files to calculate word frequencies, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizes results using graphs and word clouds. The tool allows for comprehensive text analysis, including cleaning, tokenization, and sorting of words.

##Features
* Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes input text, handling different word types and punctuation.
* Word Frequency Calculation: Calculates the frequency of each word in the input text.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes word lengths, word frequency distributions, cumulative frequency, and more.
* Word Cloud: Generates a word cloud to visually represent the most frequent words in the text.
* Top Words Visualization: Displays bar plots of the top N most frequent words in the input text.
